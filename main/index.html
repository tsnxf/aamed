                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>Our development began in 1999 when our founders pursued advanced studies in biomedicine in
                        Germany. After obtaining their degrees, they settled there and started their own business. Over
                        two decades of dedicated work have resulted in a comprehensive service company focused on
                        mutually beneficial collaboration between China and Germany.</p>
                    <p>Our headquarters are located in Duisburg, Germany, adjacent to Düsseldorf, a prime location that
                        leverages the resources of both cities to efficiently conduct our core business.</p>
                    <p>With a deep understanding of the cultures, histories, and business practices of both China and
                        Germany, we focus on three core businesses: European agency services, Sino-German business
                        exchanges, and German trade show services. We serve as the "first stop" for Chinese businesses
                        entering the German market and also provide a convenient bridge connecting German companies with
                        Chinese manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>In the future, we will continue to provide professional services, becoming a trusted strategic
                        partner for both Chinese and German companies, and contributing to mutually beneficial
                        cooperation.</p>

                    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>Deeply rooted in Sino-German connections and upholding its original aspirations for over two
                        decades, the company empowers cooperation with professionalism and builds bridges with
                        integrity. It is committed to becoming a benchmark service provider for Sino-German economic,
                        trade, and cultural exchanges, enabling Chinese companies to easily establish themselves in
                        Europe and German companies to efficiently connect with China, thus jointly building a new
                        pattern of win-win cooperation.</p>
